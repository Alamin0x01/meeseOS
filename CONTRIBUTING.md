# Contributing

If you want to contribute, but not sure what to do, here's a list of things that I always need help with:

* Bug-hunting
* Finding security problems
* Themes and general graphics
* Website design (like the homepage and manuals)
* Documentation

If you need help, or just up for some general discussion, head into the [community chat](https://gitter.im/meeseOS/community).

See [the manual](https://manual.aaronmeese.com/development/) for more information.

You can view all open issues on GitHub, which is usually a good starting point if you want to start contributing:
