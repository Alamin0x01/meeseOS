This site is based off the template of the [Developer's Portfolio](https://github.com/hashirshoaeb/home)
project, which was released under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0.

The React code here deploys the code to my [GitHub pages](https://ajmeese7.github.io) repo,
which [aaronmeese.com](https://aaronmeese.com) is pointing to for hosting.

## TODO

- Improve the look of all sections on mobile, specifically the project cards and the
size of icons/words in the home section
- Testimonials section for work, with links to projects and names
- Create a resume PDF and add it to `editable-stuff`
