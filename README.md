This site is based off the template of the [Developer's Portfolio](https://github.com/hashirshoaeb/home)
project, which was released under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0.

The React code here deploys the code to my [GitHub pages](https://ajmeese7.github.io) repo,
which [aaronmeese.com](https://aaronmeese.com) is pointing to for hosting.

To build and deploy to GitHub pages, run `npm run build` then `npm run custom-deploy`. You'll want
to have the CNAME file inside `/public` if you plan on implementing custom domain support, otherwise
it'll be overwritten every commit.

## TODO
- Fix the muted tones on the middle nav element
- Pick a better favicon and other logo sizes
  - Figure out how to change the PDF favicon
- Testimonials section for work, with links to projects and names
